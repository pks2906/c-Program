I'd like to quote one of Ankur Warikoo's famous one-liners in honour of my favourite book, DO EPIC SHIT:

" The biggest misconception people have is that they are the odd one out and everone else is sorted!"

"If you share because you are expecting something in return, it is not sharing. It is a transaction!"

"If you don't ask, the answer is always no."

"Your true friends are those who are TRULY happy for you when you succeed"

"The most dangerous people in the world are not the ones who are ignorant. They are ones who are ignorant but BELIEVE they are right!"
